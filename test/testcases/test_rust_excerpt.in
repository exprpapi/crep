Rust won’t let us annotate a type with Copy if the type, or any of its parts, has implemented the Drop trait.
If the type needs something special to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the Copy annotation to that type, we’ll get a compile-time error.
To learn about how to add the Copy annotation to your type to implement the trait, see “Derivable Traits” in Appendix C.
